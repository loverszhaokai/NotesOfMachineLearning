\subsection { Definition }

\textbf { Gradient boosting } is a method of boosting. It is a machine learning
technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a
prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically
decision trees.

It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, and
it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss
function.
